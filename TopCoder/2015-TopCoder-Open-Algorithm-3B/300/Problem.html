<html><body bgcolor="#000000" text="#ffffff"><table><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Problem Statement</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><p>Limak is a little bear who loves to play computer games.
Today he is playing a game in which the goal is to capture all bases on the map.</p>
<br></br>
<p>There are N bases on the map.
The bases are numbered 0 through N-1.
For each i, base i is located at (<b>x</b>[i], <b>y</b>[i]).
Initially, Limak only controls base 0.</p>
<br></br>
<p>Each base contains an electric cannon.
The cannon in each base that is owned by Limak is being charged at the rate of 1 unit of energy per second.
Charging happens continuously: for example, in 4.7 seconds the cannon gains 4.7 units of energy.</p>
<br></br>
<p>To capture an enemy base, Limak has to shoot it by a cannon from one of his bases.
Shot takes no time but it consumes energy.
Assume Limak wants to shoot base B using a cannon in his base A.
Let D be the Euclidean distance between bases A and B.
In order to shoot the cannon from base A to base B the cannon needs to have at least D units of energy.
Exactly D units of energy are consumed by the shot.
(I.e., at the moment of the shot the energy of the cannon in base A is decreased by D.)</p>
<br></br>
<p>At the beginning of the game the energy of the cannon in base 0 is 0.
Whenever Limak captures another base, the energy of the cannon in that base is also 0, and the cannon begins to charge immediately after the capture.
</p>
<br></br>
<p>Limak is able to fire the cannons at arbitrary, possibly non-integer times.
He is able to fire multiple cannons at the same time.
(Each of them pointed at a different enemy base.)
Limak may capture the enemy bases in any order he likes.</p>
<br></br>
<p>Return the shortest time in which Limak can capture all the bases.</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Definition</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><table><tr><td>Class:</td><td>BearCharges</td></tr><tr><td>Method:</td><td>minTime</td></tr><tr><td>Parameters:</td><td>vector &lt;int&gt;, vector &lt;int&gt;</td></tr><tr><td>Returns:</td><td>double</td></tr><tr><td>Method signature:</td><td>double minTime(vector &lt;int&gt; x, vector &lt;int&gt; y)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">(be sure your method is public)</td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Limits</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><table><tr><td>Time limit (s):</td><td>2.000</td></tr><tr><td>Memory limit (MB):</td><td>256</td></tr><tr><td>Stack limit (MB):</td><td>256</td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Notes</h3></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>Your return value must have absolute or relative error smaller than 1e-9.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Constraints</h3></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>N will be between 1 and 10, inclusive.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td><b>x</b> will have exactly N elements.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td><b>y</b> will have exactly N elements.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>Each element in <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> will be betweeen -10^9 and 10^9, inclusive.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>No two bases will be located at the same coordinates.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Examples</h3></td></tr><tr><td align="center" nowrap="true">0)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><table><tr><td><table><tr><td><pre>{10, 11, 12}</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>{0, 0, 1}</pre></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><pre>Returns: 2.414213562373095</pre></td></tr><tr><td><table><tr><td colspan="2">Wait for one unit of time and then fire the cannon in base 0 at base 1 to capture it.

At the beginning Limak controls base 0 which is located at (0,1).
After 1 second the cannon in base 0 has 1 unit of energy.
At that point he can shoot the cannon to capture base 1, which is located at (0,0).
After another sqrt(2) seconds the cannon in base 0 will have enough energy to shoot and capture base 4, which is located at (1,0).
In the meantime the cannon in the newly captured base 1 is also being charged.
One second after the capture of this base (i.e., 2 seconds after the game started) Limak can fire the cannon in base 1 to capture base 2.
After another second he can fire the cannon in base 1 to capture base 3.
